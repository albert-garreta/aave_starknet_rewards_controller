# aave_starknet_rewards_controller

This is an exercise where `RewardsController.sol` (and part of `RewardsDistributor.sol`) from Aave-V3 is written as a StarkNet contract.

Bot files `contracts/rewards_controller.cairo` and `lib/solidity_contracts/commented_RewardsController.sol` have been annotated. The recommended reading is to check both of them at the same time.

The project is built using nile's framework.
